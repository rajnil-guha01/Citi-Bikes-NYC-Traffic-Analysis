The datset schema description is as below:-

Trip Duration (seconds)
Start Time and Date
Stop Time and Date
Start Station Name
End Station Name
Station ID
Station Lat/Long
Bike ID
User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member)
Gender (Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female)
Year of Birth

This data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system, trips that are taken to/from any of our “test” stations (which we were using more in June and July 2013), and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it's secure).

We are running our used case on Databricks community edition running on a Apache Spark cluster with 6GB memory, Apache Spark 2.3.0 with Scala 2.11
